# FRC Scouter by Team 2898
**No longer maintained in favor of a new [scouting app](https://github.com/Ant-Throw-Pology/2898-scouter), please use that instead.**
This is a scouting app for First Robotics Competition events, built with Bulma. It never passed early development and is accessible [here](https://droid-kk11.github.io/frc-scouter). This app will not work on Internet Explorer 7 and prior.

<s>Contributors: All PRs must be to the **main** branch, and PRs must use Bulma elements. Any other PRs will be ignored.</s> No PRs will be accepted at this point.
