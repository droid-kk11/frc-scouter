# FRC Scouter by Team 2898
**No longer maintained in favor of a new scouting app (URL soon).**
This is a scouting app for First Robotics Competition events, built with Bulma. It is currently in early development and is accessible [here](https://droid-kk11.github.io/frc-scouter). This app will not work on Internet Explorer 7 and prior.

Contributors: All PRs must be to the **main** branch, and PRs must use Bulma elements. Any other PRs will be ignored.
